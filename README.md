# SUAS_Competiton
Collection of each year's scripts, related works for the Software Team (Object Recognition &amp; Obstacle Avoidance). This Repo serves as a way for a team to collaborate and share code, but also for future team's to reference previous year's work

## Management Advice for next software lead:
- Start recruiting at the beginning of August before Fall Semester. Will provide ample amount of time to interview and assemble a strong group for Software Team.
    - Won't have the rulebook for your competition year during recruitment, but is likely to be similar to your previous competition year.
- Split your group into necessary objectives. This will help determine the group size you would need for the project. The size can change based on experience of your group
- Consider recruitment of experienced, but also allow underclassman. If a team all graduates, then it makes it difficult for next year's software team to grasp what is needed for SUAS.
- Interview based on: 1. Time Commitment (more time commitment allows for higher chance of progress), 2. Have previous coding experience (Teaching C++ or Python is time consuming)
- Recognize you are HR & Management. You are responsible of handing tasks to your team members and ensuring the order of tasks given will keep everyone in track. Hopefully, no disputes occur, but if they do then you need to quickly resolve or cut members. There is a likely chance a lot of your time would be spent managing than actually working on the project. Again, you're the oil that keeps the machine smooth.
- Recognize that the other projects under Dr. Bhandari are your allies. Utilize them and cooperate with them to expedite issues (i.e. obtaining spare supplies, advice, and finding potential useful work assistance)
- Suggestions to use Jira or Trello to manage and assign tasks. Makes it also easier to track what tasks have been down and make documentation on progress
- Make well written documentation of what you plan for your year's competition. The documentation acts as your guide to what to complete and allows potential recruits to understand what the work will look like for your competition year.
