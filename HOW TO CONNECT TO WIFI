You need to be already connected to internet in order to use the setup wizard to connect to eduroam. Have not tested hotspot.

connect to CPPGuest
A white screen will appear and nothing will load. Do not panic, open a new firefox window
click "Open network login page"
send youself an access code through text
log into guest network with the access code

Now you can log yourself into eduroam. The wizard setup has already been installed, it just
needs be be run.

cd Downloads/
sh SecureW2_JoinNow.run

this should open a CPP SSO login page.

if all else fails, just plug in the ethernet.
